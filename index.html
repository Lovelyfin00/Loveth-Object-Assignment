                I received a job off mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, 
                if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

              <blockquote>I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to 
                make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I 
                signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly 
                thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most gruelling - time of my life. 
                Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a software
                Engineer at a VR startup.

                "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some 
                structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was 
                encouraged to apply by a former student of theirs who can onl say wonderful things 
                about the program. The entire curriculm and staff did not disappoint. They were very 
                hands-on and and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, 
                in particular was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no 
                tutorial could ever have. Infact, I've often referred to it during interviews 
                as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a 
                fullstack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended! "
